## 📌 What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that allows large language models (LLMs) to interact with tools and services in a structured, secure, and standardized way. It eliminates the need for custom API code by acting as a smart interface between LLMs and real-world applications.

> Think of MCP as a **universal adapter** for AI — connecting your language model to various tools like Gmail, Docs, Notion, or Slack without writing glue code.

---
## Why is MCP Needed Instead of Direct APIs?

-   APIs are rigid and require **custom code for each app**.

-   MCP gives a **unified way** to talk to different tools --- no matter which app.

-   It reduces complexity by **removing the need to write glue code**.

-   Think of it like giving AI a **universal remote control** instead of handing it 10 different remotes for each app.

## What is Zapier?

**Zapier is a no-code automation tool** that connects thousands of apps like Gmail, Slack, Google Drive, and more.

It traditionally follows rule-based workflows: "If this happens → then do that"
