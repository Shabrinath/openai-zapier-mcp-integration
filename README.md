## 📌 What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that allows large language models (LLMs) to interact with tools and services in a structured, secure, and standardized way. It eliminates the need for custom API code by acting as a smart interface between LLMs and real-world applications.

> Think of MCP as a **universal adapter** for AI — connecting your language model to various tools like Gmail, Docs, Notion, or Slack without writing glue code.
